### Myanimestats
Inspired by [Myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/), Myanimestats is a cli tool that helps you organize your anime
You can edit the metadata of animes such as its state (watching/completed/dropped/on hold/plan to watch), seasons, episodes, progress
Myanimestats uses a txt file (animes.txt) as an anime database, but you don't need to edit this file, because the script takes care off adding new anime or editing existing ones

### To run the tool
Run the "myanimestats.sh" script
```
./myanimestats.sh
```
Also you can use the -s flag to only show your stats
```
./myanimelist.sh -s
```

### Running first time
When you run the script the first time, you will go through a short and simple profile setup process
Then you need to run the script again to actually use it
